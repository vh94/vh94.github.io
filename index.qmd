# Factorial:

The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$ , denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.

$$n! = \prod^{n}_{i=1}{i.}$$

```{r}
recursiveFactorial <-Vectorize( 
  function(n) {
  ifelse(n==0,1,n*recursiveFactorial(n-1))
  }
)

recursiveFactorial(1:10) |> plot(type="l",log='y')
```

# Combinations:

There are $n!$ different ways of arranging $n$ distinct objects into a sequence

$$\binom nk=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \quad \textrm{for}\quad  0 \le k \le n,$$


```{r}
bin  <- function(n,k) {
  recursiveFactorial(n)/(recursiveFactorial(k)*recursiveFactorial(n-k))
}

bases <- c("A","T","G","C")
bin(length(bases),3)
```

<!-- `r combn(bases,3)|>knitr::kable()` -->
